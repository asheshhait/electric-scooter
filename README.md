# 🚀 Animated Landing Page with 3D Model | Day 5 of 30 Days of GSAP

This is **Day 5** of my **30 Days of GSAP Challenge**.  
I created a visually stunning landing page using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **GSAP** for animations.  
To enhance the visual experience, a **3D model** is embedded using the `<model-viewer>` tag.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

## 🎯 Features

- **GSAP animations** for smooth entrance transitions, button hovers, and text animations.
- Integrated **3D model viewer** for interactive visual content.
- Minimal and modern design that adapts across devices.

## 🚀 How It Works
- The layout is built using semantic HTML and styled with modern CSS.
- GSAP animates elements on page load and scroll.
- The 3D model is embedded using `<model-viewer>` with support for orbit controls and auto-rotation.
